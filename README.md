# 2D-monkey-climber
 2D gaming project


Changes to game from initial concept:
My changes include going from a hardcore rage game to a simple you miss your platform you fall lose your progress, but there is an added step of lava/water chasing you and if you fall in it you die and have to restart. You collect banana's for points trying to get as many as you can. There aren't any items or power ups
because that proved to be a lot harder to deal with than I thought. I created multiple assests myself. This is technically my second game cause the first game I was reorganizing my assets/files and deleted the old one and it removed everything. So I created a closer representation of my initial Idea.
